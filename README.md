SafariBooksStyleReplace
=======================

Cleans up the fonts in Safari books Online, and removes the tag and higlight box that appears when you select text.

I created a page to explain [usage and how to create the bookmarklet](https://robert-reese.squarespace.com/blog/cleaning-up-safari-books-fonts).
